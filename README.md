# Rapido-Data-Analytics-Project
This project showcases data analysis and visualization for Rapido ride bookings using SQL and Power BI.
The objective is to derive meaningful insights into booking performance, cancellations, revenue, and ratings.
The project is divided into two parts:
SQL Queries – Extracting and analyzing data directly from the bookings database.
Power BI Dashboards – Building interactive visualizations to understand ride trends, cancellations, revenue, and ratings.

**The Suggested Buisiness Recomedations from this Project insights to Rapido to help reduce cancellations, increase revenue, and enhance overall customer and driver satisfaction, ultimately boosting growth and retention are:**

1. Reduce Cancellations
Customer Cancellations (wrong address, change of plans):
Improve location accuracy in the app (better GPS, auto-correction of addresses).
Add flexible rescheduling options instead of cancellation.
Driver Cancellations (personal & car-related issues):
Introduce driver incentive programs to reduce last-minute dropouts.
Provide maintenance support or micro-loans to drivers for vehicle issues.

2. Optimize Revenue Channels
UPI and Wallet are among the most preferred payment methods → Run cashback offers & loyalty programs to push more digital payments.
Identify top-paying customers (whales) and introduce premium membership plans with priority booking and discounts.

3. Enhance Customer Experience
Prime Sedan rides show variation in ratings → Investigate service gaps (cleanliness, driver behavior, comfort) and set quality benchmarks.
Offer in-app support chat for quick issue resolution during rides.
Introduce a ride feedback loop: reward customers and drivers who consistently give or receive high ratings.

4. Improve Driver Engagement & Retention
Recognize top-rated drivers with badges, bonuses, or early ride allocations.
Provide training sessions to help drivers improve communication, punctuality, and professionalism.
Reduce idle driver time by improving ride allocation algorithms based on demand forecasting.

5. Strategic Expansion & Marketing
From ride volume over time, identify peak booking hours & days → Run surge pricing and driver availability boosts.
Promote vehicle types with high demand & distance coverage (e.g., scooters for short city trips, sedans for long rides).
Use ride distance distribution insights to design dynamic pricing models (short vs. long rides).
